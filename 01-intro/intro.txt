AMI = Amazon Machine Images

EKS Data Plane, three ways to create a EKS cluster
- Amazon EC2 - Self Managed Node Groups: You maintain EC2 instances, upgrades and use custom AMI
- Amazon EC2 - Managed Node Groups: AWS maintains EC2, upgrades and AMI 
- AWS Fargate - Serverless: No EC2 instances

Other tools can be integrated:
- kubectl 
- graphana, prometheus, fluentbit, etc.

Costs: 
- Master: flat charge 10 cent/hour
- Nodes: price depends on the EC2 (m5.*)

Amount of PODs
- Depends on the instance types, for example, with a t3.micro you can only run 4 PODs
- The bigger the instance the more pods you can create

Spin up a EKS cluster:
- AWS Console
- CloudFormation
- AWS CLI 
- eksctl (Preferred)
- DevOps tools (Jenkins, Gitlab)
